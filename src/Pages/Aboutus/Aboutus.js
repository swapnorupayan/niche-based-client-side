                    <p className='col-12'> Pragoti Industries Limited (PIL) is among the oldest and largest automobile assemblers in Bangladesh.[1] The company has assembled over 50,000 vehicles since its inception in 1966.[1] In February 2010, Japanese car manufacturer Mitsubishi officially proposed to the Bangladesh government to locally assemble the Mitsubishi Pajero Sport in collaboration with Pragoti.[1] Operations commenced in August 2011, with an annual production output of around 500 units.

                        In 2009, the Malaysian Agate Group proposed to build a car manufacturing plant in Bangladesh in cooperation with Walton, which itself is preparing to produce motorcycles.[3] In the same year, car manufacturing company TagAZ announced that they would build their third factory in Bangladesh, aiming for exporting. The plant was supposed to be completed by 2012.[4] But the company fell in bankruptcy.

                        In March 2015, PHP Group and Proton announced plans to assemble Proton cars in Bangladesh.[5] A new Tk 400 crore assembly plant would be constructed in Chittagong to facilitate an annual production output of 1,200 units.[5] In May 2017, PHP Automobiles launched the Bangladeshi-built Proton Prevé.[6] The company intends to market the Prevé as an alternative to used imported cars which dominate the local market.[7]

                        In August 2018, Foton Motor, a Chinese vehicle manufacturer, announced to set up a plant in Bangladesh by next year to assemble commercial vehicles in a joint venture with ACI Motors [8]

                        In May 2019, Japanese automaker giant Mitsubishi Motors decided to invest $100 million in Bangladesh to produce its branded vehicles. The company will invest the sum at the Mirsarai Economic Zone in Chittagong, initially for assembling cars and will gradually upgrade the assembly plant to a full car manufacturing plant.
